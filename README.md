LangChain Crash Course: Building LLM-Powered Applications
This repository provides a comprehensive guide and code resources to build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using LangChain. The content is based on a detailed walkthrough from the YouTube crash course, focusing on integrating LLMs, creating custom chains, and implementing real-world applications.

Key Concepts Covered:
Introduction to LangChain:
Learn the fundamentals of LangChain and how it simplifies the development of applications that utilize LLMs like GPT.

Custom Chains and Pipelines:
Understand how to design and build custom chains for more complex workflows using LangChainâ€™s modular components.

Memory and Context Management:
Implement persistent memory and context retention across interactions, enabling more natural and contextual conversations.

Prompt Engineering and Optimization:
Get insights into crafting effective prompts and dynamically adjusting them based on user interactions.

Document Handling and Q&A Systems:
Learn how to process documents, chunk content, and use vector embeddings for question-answering over specific documents.

Integrating APIs and External Tools:
Explore how to connect external APIs and tools, making your LLM applications more versatile and powerful.

Deployment and UI/UX with Streamlit:
Build a user-friendly interface with Streamlit to interact with your LangChain-powered applications.
